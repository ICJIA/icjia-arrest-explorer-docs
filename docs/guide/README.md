## Introduction

_ICJIA Arrest Explorer_ is the latest iteration of the ICJIA Research & Analysis (R&A) Unit's ongoing effort to bring criminal justice data to the public. It seeks to provide aggregated arrest information from the Illinois State Police's Criminal History Records Information (CHRI) system.

This project is born out of a desire and need to provide the public with unique insights drawn from the CHRI records. While CHRI records are collected primarily for creating individualsâ€™ criminal history transcripts and are confidential per state law [[20 ILCS 2630/7](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=350&ChapterID=5)], in de-identified aggregate form, they are a unique statewide source of criminal justice data on demographic and offense-related variables not available elsewhere.
