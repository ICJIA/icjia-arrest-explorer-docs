## Introduction

_Arrest Explorer_ is the latest iteration of the ICJIA Research & Analysis Unit's ongoing effort to bring criminal justice data to the public. It seeks to provide aggregated arrest information from the Illinois State Police's Criminal History Records Information (CHRI) system.

This project is born out of a desire to provide the public with unique insights drawn from the CHRI records. While CHRI records are collected primarily for creating individuals' criminal history transcripts and are confidential per state law [[20 ILCS 2630/7](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=350&ChapterID=5)], in de-identified aggregate form they are a unique statewide source of criminal justice data, including demographic and offense-related variables.

### How to access _Arrest Explorer_ data

There are two main ways to access data provided by the _Arrest Explorer_:

1. Using the [interactive data explorer](./explorer) on the [_Arrest Explorer_ website](https://icjia-arrest-explorer.netlify.app).
2. Making HTTP request to the [_Arrest Explorer_ API server](./api).
