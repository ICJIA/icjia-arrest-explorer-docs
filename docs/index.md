# Introduction

This project makes aggregated Illinois arrest data publicly available, and provides a graphical and programming interface to it.

For example, here is a plot of total arrests by year:

<iframe title="Plot of Illinois Arrests by Year" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" src="https://icjia.illinois.gov/arrestexplorer/?embed"></iframe>

This plot is an embedded version of the **graphical interface**:

> [icjia.illinois.gov/arrestexplorer](https://icjia.illinois.gov/arrestexplorer)

You can download its underlying data from the export menu, or through the **programming interface**:

> [icjia.illinois.gov/arrestexplorer/api](https://icjia.illinois.gov/arrestexplorer/api)

For more about using the Application Programming Interface, see the [API](/api) page.

For more about the original data and how they are aggregated, see the [Data](/data) page.
